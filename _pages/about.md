I am a 5th year PhD student in the [Algorithms, Combinatorics, and Optimization](https://aco.math.cmu.edu/) program in the Tepper School of Business at Carnegie Mellon University.  Before that I studied [Computer Engineering](https://www.lsu.edu/eng/ece/) at Lousiana State University.  My research is in algorithm design and analysis, with a focus on Machine Learning/Data Driven approaches to algorithm design.  Outside of my research, I enjoy rock climbing and listening to music/podcasts.
